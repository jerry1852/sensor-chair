# sensor-chair
This reposity is for the CExAM project: Sensor chair. It contains all codings for measurement and calculation.

The processing:

Setting up the arduino (IF everything is fine, you can see intial success in thw window. Attention, you need to change the file name each time) and Bitalino.

Synchronized Arduino and Bitalino raw data

Calculate all the results




Measurement Coding:

Measuremen coding is based on the Arduino Ino. It consist of pressure sensors, EDA sensors, PPG sensros, microphones, LED, sunchronized signal, siwtch. In order to run the program, you need to install all the files in the totalsensor folder. In this folder, totalsensor.ino is main file. Just run it in the Arduino Ino.

The header of csv file:

Time, Left pressure sensor, right pressure sensor, combined EDA, 3d printed EDA, microphone (not use), PPG signal (RED), PPG signal (IR), LED state, Synchronized signal.


Attention: In the totalsensor.ino, there in one line coding in line 110. You need to change the file name each time. And the format of the file should nnoe exceed 7 charaters. (Part1 or t1000 is a goog file name)

respiratory_calï¼š

This algorithm is used for calculating breathing rate using the pressure data. In the coding, I used two different methods to get the result. One is autocorrelation corresponding to the Microsoft's paper. Another is main lobe spectrum. Besides these two methods, there is one more method using peak detections, but not in this coding. 

syns.m: (under development)

This algorithm is used for synchronized the Bitalino signal and subtract the breating belt data, ECG data and EDA data. It is based on the time stamp. However, for the later design, we can use synchronized signal for Bitalino. So we need do some adjustment. 

synnoraxon (not used):

Same as Bitalino one.

heartrate.m:

Heartrate.m This algorithm is used for calculating heart rate, It is based on peterhcharlton dataset. Before running Heartrate.m, you need to download all files from

https://github.com/peterhcharlton/ppg-beats

And put Heartrate.m into the folder, then you can run it.

chairsyns.m:

This algorithm is used to sunchronized chair signal. The only thing that you should input is the arduino csv data.;) And also convert and standardlized the  raw EDA data.

EDA_cal.m:

This algorithm is used to calculate EDA precision, recall and F1. It need csv file from Visual studio.
